# What to do

## Usage

In order to make it easier for you to use our services and establish mutually beneficial cooperation, we compile API usage instructions that must be followed:

* You are allowed to cache the results of our data. You can use this cache to create an auto-complete feature for your app.
* It is forbidden to use bots, cron, or automatic scripts that make requests to our services, without any action from the user. Like 'dumping' data, auto-update status of receipt numbers, and others. This can burden the expedition server so that it affects all users.

## API Key

Before you connect to our services make sure you already got API Key from our __Server Administrator__.

Place your API Key in header every request to our services and always make sure its secret.
